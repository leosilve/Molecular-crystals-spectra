Input data for band calculations
--------------------------------
Every input value must be placed after a double dot sign. No double dots must be used elsewhere in this file.

kdirs: 0.727725 0 0 0 0.256665 0.0320157 0 0 0.65036

       (gives the directions along which bands are computed, kx ky kz must be supplied (in Angstroems^-1) for each direction, 
        bands are computed from 0.001*k to k/2, reads the whole line, so don't add anything else)

flag_macro: 1 (set to 0 if the long-range macroscopic part of the Ewald sum must not be included in the Ewald calculation)

n_points: 10 (number of points sampled along each direction)

nGrid: 48 48 48 (number of points in a 3D grid sampling the first Brillouin zone,
              three even integers must be supplied)
